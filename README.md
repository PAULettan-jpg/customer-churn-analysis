# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes customer behavior to identify the factors driving churn and builds a machine learning model to predict customers at risk of leaving.

## Key Insights
- ~56% of customers churned, indicating a major retention challenge.
- Frequent support calls strongly correlate with churn.
- Low engagement and lower spending increase churn risk.
- Billing friction and payment delays contribute to customer loss.

## Model Performance
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: ~99%
- Successfully identifies high-risk customers before churn.

## Business Impact
The predictive model enables proactive retention strategies, improving customer loyalty and long-term profitability.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
